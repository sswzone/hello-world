# hello-world
This is my introduction to GitHub via my first repository called hello-world

Hello all. I love technology. I've been involved with it ever since I started building small p-box kits that Radio Shack used to sell back in he late 60's. I really became enthusiastic about it when I build a Heathkit H-89 computer while I was still in high school. For the last 10 years I have been a IT Manager by trade. Raspberry Pi, Particle, IoT, SmartThings, etc. have reignited my childhood curisosity and I'm excited to delve into the programming and development side of these products
